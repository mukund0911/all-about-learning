## The Idea

## Simple Linear Regression
As the name implies, simple linear regression is a very straightforward approach of predicting the output variable $Y$ based on a linear combination of input variables. Mathematically, 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot X$$, 
where $\beta_0, \beta_1$ represent the intercept and slope of the linear model respectively.

## Multiple Linear Regression

### Estimating the Coefficients \(\hat{\beta}_p\) for all \(p = 1, \cdots, P\)

### Limitations
